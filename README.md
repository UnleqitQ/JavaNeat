# JavaNeat
This is my own implementation of "neat-python" in Java.
I couldn't find any implementation, that is usable for everything, just implementations which can only be used in specific games etc.
I really worked hard on it so please take it as it is.
I am also not done with it but that will come!

I hope it is useful to you!
